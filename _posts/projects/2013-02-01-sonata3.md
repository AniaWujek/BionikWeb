The aim of the research is to develop a method of design and implementation of intelligent service robots. It has been established that in order to execute the tasks formerly exclusively performed by humans, such a system requires sensors corresponding to human senses such as sight and perception of force as well as appropriate processing algorithms. In this project we focus on developing the algorithms and the technology necessary for creating a working robotic system, able to locate and classify objects, generate an appropriate plan of approaching those objects and, in the final phase, their classification and manipulation using appropriate tool assuming that the object have internal degrees of freedom.
